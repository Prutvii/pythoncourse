this is just an simple python code pushes by me, by following Tanvi maam.
  The code doesn't consist more content,
it has just an main file,
an python project toml file,
and an lock file 
    this just an basic example to learn that how can we push our codes in our git account with the help of terminal commands and Visual Studio (VS)Code...!!
